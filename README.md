# nsapple 2.0
apple watch app for Nightscout / Loop followers

# Goal
nsapple was originally written to follow BG data from Nightscout.  It has morphed (mostly thru quick hacks) to add data from Loop. nsapple 2.0 is a first attempt to clean up the code base and make it more useable, reliable, less resource intenstive and more responsive.
